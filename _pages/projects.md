Here is a sampling of some projects I've done outside of work. Enjoy! :)

### [Modeling COVID-19 Prevalence in US Prisons][Modeling COVID]
![Graph]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/modeling-covid-graph.png)

In this project, I used Python, the Epidemics on Networks (EoN) Python package, and Jupyter Notebooks to
explore the effects of various interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in US prisons. This project was 
done as the final project of my UCLA *Introduction to Networks* course. It was a group project, with my 
group being me, Marcel Burgunder, Emma Broback, and Sam Briante. I did most of the coding and some 
writing. Marcel did some coding and lots of writing. Read our results [here][Modeling COVID Report].
