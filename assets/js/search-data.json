In this project, I used Python, the Epidemics on Networks (EoN) Python package, and Jupyter Notebooks to explore the effects of various interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in US prisons. This project was done as the final project of my UCLA Introduction to Networks course. It was a group project, with my group being me, Marcel Burgunder, Emma Broback, and Sam Briante. I did most of the coding and some writing. Marcel did some coding and lots of writing. Read our results here. .",
