title:  "Big Cat Classifier App"
---
I made a web app that classifies an image as either a lion, tiger, or leopard! Check it out [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bwolfson97/big-cat-classifier-app/master?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Fbig-cat-classifier-app.ipynb)!

Note, this post will be updated with more information later! :)
