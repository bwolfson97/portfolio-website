Similar to my [Big Cat Classifier]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/08/08/big-cat-classifier-app.html), I made a simple web app that classifies images of leafs as poison oak or not! Check it out [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bwolfson97/poison-oak-classifier/master?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Fpoison-oak-classifier.ipynb)!

If you're interested in how I made this app, check out the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/bwolfson97/poison-oak-classifier).
Note, it may take about a minute for the app to launch.
