title:  "Poison Oak Classifier"
---
Similar to my [Big Cat Classifier][Big Cat Classifier], I made a simple web app that classifies images of leafs as poison oak or not! Check it out [here][poison-oak-classifier-app]!

If you're interested in how I made this app, check out the GitHub repo [here][poison-oak-classifier-github].
Note, it may take about a minute for the app to launch.
